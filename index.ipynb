I took a bite out of each on to confirm what I thought they were the worst doughnuts I have ever had.

They took a situation that was less than idea at the All Star Race and turned it into a customer service win. Here is what happened. I used Ticketmaster to buy 6 tickets to the All Star Race. I browsed a few sections then wound up buying tickets in Chrysler section K. When we arrived at our section we were informed that it was a no alcohol section. I didn't remember seeing anything on the website (i went back and looked and there was at the checkout page and because of the way I searched I missed the one on the main page) or on my tickets. I was told to go exchange my tickets the gate. The employees at gate 3 said they did not have access to the Ticketmaster system so I would have to go to gate 4. At this point I'm not pleased but I head to gate 4. I show the employee my tickets on my phone and he hands in over to someone else. After about 20 or 30 minutes I'm informed by someone who I assume is a supervisor that the usher is wrong and that our tickets are not in an alcohol free zone and there is no need to exchange them and that the map displayed in the window of the ticket booth showing this as an alcohol free zone was wrong and out of date. At this point we have missed about a 1/4 of qualifying. We head back to our seats and inform the usher that we were told that it was ok to drink here. He said absolutely not and that the ticket person was wrong. At this point I'm furious. So we walk down into the next section and head toward the bottom to find some open seats and hope we are not sitting in someone else's seats (luckily we weren't as most of them around us filled up). Upon calling the ticket office today and explaining what happened the agent said I did miss the no alcohol writing at the checkout page but offered me 6 tickets to next years race to make up for the inconvenience!!!

We went on a Sunday afternoon and it just us and like a couple of other tables so they were not busy at all and the service was so incredibly slow and bad. Our appetizer and the kids meal we ordered came out pretty fast but then we literally waited for like 30 minutes for our food which we learned later was just sitting under the heat lamps for like 15 minutes. There were like 3 servers hanging around not busy while our food just sat there. And our server was hanging out at a table sitting with them for like 10 minutes when our food was just sitting there. Finally we got up and asked where our food was and it still took another 5 or so minutes for someone to bring it. The tacos were soggy by this time and not good. Aside from the bad service the food was just a total let down. The kids meal was gross and our tacos were soggy and it seems the oil was old because everything fried had a bad taste to it.

The servers at the bar where very rude and no one offered to take our order or seat us. Then there was an open booth near the front and we asked to sit at that table and one of the servers told us that it was taken even though no one was sitting there. Like 10 minutes later a white couple came in and they offered the booth to them. We finally realized that there was a back room with empty tables and we went and seated ourselves and literally waited for 15 minutes before anyone even walked over to our table to ask for our drinks. They saw us seat ourselves which is why we finally got the hint that we were not welcome and got up and left. I think unless your a local in the neighborhood I would not visit this place.

First was an employee wouldn't let a mom in front of me in line exchange a pair of kids shoes for a smaller size. She didn't have a receipt but all she was asking to do was get a smaller size. She ended up leaving in tears and the employee did nothing to help her. Second experience was we bought a lawn mower in 2014 and got the extended 3 year warranty. The sales associate assured us that if we canceled within the 3 year time frame we would get 100% of the warranty price back. Well here it is almost 3 years later and Sears will only refund $44 of the $249 price of the warranty. So the sales associate just lied to our face and management will do nothing to refund the full $249. Never shopping here again.,0,rbFG2hvQPA0Vca2cBGomFQ\\n\",\n",
